ROOM COUNTER PROJECT

Going by file type I will explain what each file contained inside the project directory does.


1. dofile.do --> executes commands sequentially. Used for the testbench simulation in ModelSim

2. conceptual diagram.pdf --> Before writing VHDL code, a conceptual version was drawn using OneNote
3. Detailed_schematic.pdf --> Detailed implementation by Vivado Software of the synthesized VHDL code
4. Expectations-of-Originality.pdf --> Confirm this is my work and my work only & Signature 
5. RTL_schematic.pdf 	  --> Register Transfer Level implementation by Vivado Software of the VHDL code

6. SIMULATION.png	  --> ModelSim testbench (compressed 8-bit data bus), I/O pins only
7. Detailed_simulation.png --> ModelSim testbench (expanded version with individual bits), I/O pins only

8. VivadoLog.txt	  --> Vivado Log file

9. enter_sensor_logic	  --> VHDL code 
10. RoomCounter		  --> VHDL code (requires "enter_sensor_logic" to be compiled)
