# RoomCounter
Digital Systems project. Real-time system with photocell sensors

# Room Occupancy Monitoring System

This project implements a **digital room occupancy counter** using VHDL. It simulates a smart room that tracks the number of people entering and exiting via binary sensor signals, and prevents over-occupancy by asserting a `max_capacity` signal when full.

‚úÖ Designed for use with ModelSim and target synthesis on a Xilinx Nexys A7 FPGA board.

## üîß Features

- Tracks the number of occupants using `enter_sensor` and `exit_sensor`
- Programmable 8-bit maximum occupancy
- Outputs current occupancy and a `max_capacity` flag when full
- Simulates real-world entry with 20 ns pulse-based inputs
- Includes a ModelSim `.do` file to automate testing
- Synthesizable and resource-efficient for FPGA deployment
